Dear Mr.Chen 

I'm a student from your Data Mining course.
Because I am a part-time student, I have to go to office before 10 o'clock.
I'm glad to take part in the 3rd time video talk because on my vacation.But without preview,I felt difficult taking part in the talk and understand some information. 

Actually I got Shame and frustration after that day.
Without enough time, and I always got pressure from my parents and my girlfriend.So I missed the left lessons until now.
After getting invite from Ms.Tang last Thursday, I agreed to attend the meeting that Friday.But for personal matters, I missed the meeting again.
In my case,it's difficult to finish Data Mining course. So I wish you could forgive my absence.

Be honest,I have finished some courses until now.But I think I have learned little useful information for me.
On the contrary,I get too much pressure from study than my job.

on the last two days, I met some matters and felt confused again.
with some struggles,I have decided that after the end of the school year, I will quit school or quit my job.Only with this way, I can feel better.

Maybe some of the above words are redundant, but I hope to explain my personal situation to you clearly and I wish you could understand and agree to my withdrawal from the course.
Thanks & Best Regards
Yujia Jiang
